  ~ THE VERY MAIN FOCUS OF THIS MOD IS TO MAKE YOUR WORLD MORE CHALLENGING AND INTENSE. IT ALSO ADDS FEW ASSORTED STUFF SUCH AS MAPS AND ITEMS.
  ~ MOST OF THE CREATURES CAME FROM VARIOUS REFERENCES, NOTABLY "DEAD FRONTIER". While others are miscellaneous and made-up addition, just to widen the bestiary(and interest).

  *This README.txt is my changelog, so what is done will be recorded(after v1.2) and released after a week. Always check this repository for the newest updates ;)
