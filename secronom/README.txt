  ~ THE VERY MAIN FOCUS OF THIS MOD IS TO MAKE YOUR WORLD MORE CHALLENGING AND INTENSE BY ADDING WHOLESOME DREADFUL CREATURES. IT ALSO ADDS FEW ASSORTED STUFF SUCH AS MAPS AND ITEMS.
  ~ MOST OF THE CREATURES CAME FROM VARIOUS REFERENCES, NOTABLY "DEAD FRONTIER". While others are miscellaneous and made-up addition, just to widen the bestiary(and interest).

  *This README.txt is my changelog, so what is done will be recorded and released depending on accumulated progress. Since I publish new contents less than 2 days, make sure to check this repository for the newest updates.
  *AND LASTLY... PLEASE, notify me of any bugs you encountered while playing along with this mod. I'd like to hear petitions from every players who supports ^_^
