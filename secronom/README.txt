Secronom V1.2 - Axema Vales

  ~ THE VERY MAIN FOCUS OF THIS MOD IS TO MAKE YOUR WORLD MORE CHALLENGING AND INTENSE. IT ALSO ADDS FEW ASSORTED STUFF SUCH AS MAPS AND ITEMS.
  ~ MOST OF THE CREATURES CAME FROM VARIOUS REFERENCES, NOTABLY "DEAD FRONTIER". While others are miscellaneous and made-up addition, just to widen the bestiary(and interest).

  *A little work that changed the mod a lot... AND IT TOOK 2 WEEKS TO UPDATE IT (sorry about that).
  *Most tileset were remaked versions from MSX++DEAD_PEOPLE(thanks to the creator), in order to visualize some secronom creatures... AT THIS POINT, they aren't good (because I ain't good with pixelarts).
