# Secronom: A Modification File for Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead

Its mod thread is at the [official forums](https://discourse.cataclysmdda.org/t/secronom-zombies-mod-thread/16211/1).

An alteration of Dead Frontier into the Cataclysm world. That game is probably dead, so scavenging is a better thing to do.

- This mod is at its stable status. Expect lesser updates or nothing to occur.

## Zombies
The secronom aims to add various zombies to the world, ranging from weak up to strong variety of them.
